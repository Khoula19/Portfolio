# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio! In this portfolio, I demonstrate my expertise in three key areas of data analysis:

1. **Power BI**: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
2. **Excel**: Performing data analysis, forecasting, and creating visual reports.
3. **SQL**: Extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data from relational databases.

Each project showcases my skills and thought process for solving real-world business problems using these tools.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Power BI Dashboards
In this section, you will find interactive reports and dashboards built using Power BI.

- **Sales Marketing Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard to track key sales metrics like total sales, profit margins, and campaign performance. It includes slicers for filtering by region and product type.
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: A dashboard to analyze customer churn over time, segmenting by factors like customer demographics and subscription types. It helps in identifying key drivers of churn.

### 2. Excel Projects
This section includes Excel-based analysis and reporting projects.

- **Sales Forecasting**: A project where I used Excel's forecasting tools to predict future sales based on historical data. It includes charts and a regression model.
- **Customer Segmentation**: An Excel file where I performed clustering analysis to segment customers based on purchasing patterns. Pivot tables and charts are used to visualize the segments.

### 3. SQL Projects
These SQL scripts showcase my ability to query, aggregate, and manipulate data from relational databases.

- **Customer Data Analysis**: A set of SQL queries to extract and analyze customer data, including segmentation and profiling.
- **Sales Analysis**: SQL queries to aggregate sales data by product, region, and time period. This includes joins across multiple tables and aggregations.

## How to View and Use These Projects

1. **Power BI**: You can view the Power BI dashboards by downloading the `.pbix` files and opening them in Power BI Desktop. You may need access to the same or similar data sources for full functionality.
2. **Excel**: Open the `.xlsx` files in Microsoft Excel to explore the analysis, charts, and formulas used in each project.
3. **SQL**: The `.sql` files can be opened and run in any SQL-based database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. You can modify the queries to match your dataset.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: Data analysis, pivot tables, and forecasting.
- **SQL**: Querying, data manipulation, and analysis.
