Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio! In this portfolio, I demonstrate my expertise in key areas of data analysis and visualization. My projects utilize tools such as Power BI and Excel, with a focus on solving real-world business problems through data-driven insights.

Projects Overview
1. Power BI Dashboards
This section highlights interactive reports and dashboards built using Power BI.

Superstore Sales Forecasting Dashboard: An interactive dashboard that tracks sales data and predicts future trends over a 15-day period. The dashboard includes sales forecasts, sales by region, and a breakdown of sales by subcategory. Users can explore the sales data over time, with clear visualizations of trends, fluctuations, and key metrics.
Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard: A detailed dashboard that analyzes sales and profits across various segments, payment modes, regions, and categories. It visualizes data like total sales, profit margins, quantities sold, and regional performance. Interactive filters allow users to drill down and explore specific segments and months.
2. Excel Projects
This section includes Excel-based analysis and reporting projects.

Sales Forecasting: A project where I used Excelâ€™s forecasting tools to predict future sales based on historical data. It includes regression models, visual charts, and forecasts to help understand sales patterns over time.
Sales Data Analysis: An Excel file where I analyzed sales data, performed data cleaning, and visualized key insights. This included tracking sales by different variables such as region, subcategory, and month. Pivot tables and charts are used to summarize and present the data.
3. SQL Projects
These SQL scripts showcase my ability to query, aggregate, and manipulate data from relational databases.

Sales Data Analysis: A set of SQL queries to aggregate and analyze sales data from a relational database. It includes joins, groupings, and aggregations based on product categories, regions, and time periods.
Customer and Sales Segmentation: SQL queries to segment customers and analyze their purchasing behavior. This project helps in identifying high-value customers and patterns that can drive targeted marketing strategies.
